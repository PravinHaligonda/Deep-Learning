## Deep Learning ~ Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville

### Overview
Deep Learning concepts often rely on complex mathematics.
This project focuses on implementing these mathematical formulas into Python code to provide an intuitive understanding of theory behind deep learning.

By following the chapters in the `"Deep Learning"` book, each concept is carefully broken down into code, allowing you to:
1. Understand the math behind deep learning
2. Learn to translate theory into practical code.
3. Build foundational skills for developing deep learning models from scratch

### Features 
* Mathematical Intuition:
    Explanation and step-by-step implementation of key formulas.
* Code Examples:
    Easy-to-follow Python scripts for each concept.
* Visualization:
    Graphs and charts where needed, for better understanding.
* Reproducibility:
    Clear instructions and examples for running the codes.

###  Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:
* Python (>= 3.8)
* Required Python Libraries:
`Numpy Matplotlib Pandas Scikit-learn Pytorch Jupyter`

### Usage
Each chapter or topic is implemented in jupyter notebook in it's dedicated folder.
Feel free to explore the scripts and modify parameters to test your understanding.

### Contribution
Contributions are welcome!
